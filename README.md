A website built from scratch using HTML, CSS and Javascript with a fully functioning search engine using the google custom search API.

In order to run the project locally you should download the repo onto your computer. After you do so you will open the index.html and will have access to the rest of the website.

A brief overview of the website

The 'course' tab has links to a few different websites that I used in the class that this project was assigned.

The 'About' tab has basic info about me, the developer, and a contact page.

The 'Browser' tab allows you to learn about your system as well as give you your current location.

The 'Search' tab gives you access to the google search engine and the file parser.
